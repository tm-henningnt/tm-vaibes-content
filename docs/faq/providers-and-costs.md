Cost drivers

- Tokens in/out, model size, and latency.
- Streaming improves UX; truncation and summaries lower cost.

Rate limits

- Providers enforce RPM/TPM and concurrent request caps; apply retries and backoff.

When to switch

- Data residency/compliance needs; tool use capabilities; latency regions; cost ceilings.
