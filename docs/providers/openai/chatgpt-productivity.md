Principles

- Be specific: give role, audience, and format.
- Keep responses short by default; ask for expansions when needed.
- Use structured outputs (bullets, JSON) when you’ll copy into tools.

Prompt templates

- Planning: “Act as a project coordinator. In 5 bullets, propose a one-week plan to [goal]. Include owners and time estimates.”
- Writing: “You are a concise technical writer. Draft a 150-word intro about [topic] for [audience]. Tone: friendly, direct.”
- Review: “You are an editor. Critique the text below for clarity and correctness. Return bullets with issues and fixes.”

Safety tips

- Do not paste secrets or regulated data.
- Add a caution line in your prompts when brainstorming: “Do not fabricate facts; say ‘unknown’ if unsure.”
- Cross-check with authoritative sources before sharing externally.

Limitations

- Hallucinations happen—prefer grounded prompts with references when correctness matters.
- Long prompts degrade quality; prefer short, focused requests.

Next

- For server-side automation, use `/docs/quickstarts/js-server-route.md` or `/docs/quickstarts/python-fastapi.md`.
