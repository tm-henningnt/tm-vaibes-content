## Overview
This guide walks through the practical steps to authenticate with the OpenAI API, select the right model tier for your workload, and guard against quota or latency surprises. It assumes you manage keys on the server and want production-ready defaults from day one.

### You’ll learn
- How to provision and store OpenAI API keys securely
- Environment variable patterns for local development and deployments
- Model selection heuristics for chat, tools, embeddings, and multimodal use cases
- How to monitor and respect rate limits, token quotas, and billing controls
- Common troubleshooting tips when calls fail or quality drifts

## Set up authentication
1. **Create an API key** in the OpenAI dashboard (User menu → View API keys). Generate a secret key scoped to your organization workspace.
2. **Store it securely** using your platform’s secret manager (e.g., 1Password, AWS Secrets Manager, Vercel environment variables). Never embed keys in client code or mobile apps.
3. **Reference the key via environment variables**. Adopt consistent naming so your infrastructure and CI pipelines remain portable.

```bash
# .env or secret manager entries
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
OPENAI_ORG_ID=org-...
```

> **Tip:** Rotate keys quarterly or when collaborators leave. Update downstream services via infrastructure-as-code to avoid manual drift.

### Minimal Node client
```ts
import OpenAI from 'openai';

const client = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  organization: process.env.OPENAI_ORG_ID // optional but useful for shared workspaces
});

export async function summarizeReleaseNotes(text: string) {
  const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
    model: 'gpt-4o-mini',
    messages: [
      { role: 'system', content: 'You summarize product updates in 3 bullet points.' },
      { role: 'user', content: text }
    ],
    max_tokens: 300,
    temperature: 0.3
  });

  return response.choices[0]?.message?.content ?? '';
}
```

### Minimal Python client
```python
import os
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key=os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"],
    organization=os.getenv("OPENAI_ORG_ID")
)

def summarize_release_notes(text: str) -> str:
    completion = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You summarize product updates in 3 bullet points."},
            {"role": "user", "content": text}
        ],
        max_tokens=300,
        temperature=0.3
    )
    return completion.choices[0].message.content or ""
```

## Model selection cheat sheet
| Scenario | Recommended starting model | Why | Upgrade path |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Drafting, summarizing, chatbots | `gpt-4o-mini` | Low latency, competitive quality, tool support | Escalate to `gpt-4o` if nuance or multimodal fidelity lags |
| Complex reasoning, multi-step tools | `gpt-4o` | Better reasoning, longer context window, higher reliability | Test `gpt-4.1` previews for advanced planning |
| Structured outputs / JSON | `gpt-4o-mini` with JSON mode | Enforces schemas at lower cost | Upgrade to `gpt-4o` for longer outputs |
| Embeddings for RAG | `text-embedding-3-large` for recall or `3-small` for cost | Latest embedding families with improved semantic recall | Consider hybrid search with provider-agnostic vector DB |
| Multimodal (text+image) | `gpt-4o` or `gpt-4o-mini` | Native multimodal support | Evaluate `gpt-4.1` when higher visual reasoning is needed |

Always review the [OpenAI model index](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) before deployment; pricing and availability change frequently.

## Control tokens, cost, and latency
- **Set `max_tokens`** to the minimum viable ceiling; lower numbers reduce spend and latency spikes.
- **Stream responses** (set `stream: true`) in conversational UIs to deliver first tokens quickly.
- **Cache static context** like instructions or knowledge base snippets to avoid re-sending them on every call.
- **Summarize history** using sliding window prompts or conversation memory tables when chats run long.
- **Log token usage** (`usage.prompt_tokens`, `usage.completion_tokens`) to track cost trends per feature or tenant.

### Handling rate limits and errors
Status | Meaning | Mitigation
--- | --- | ---
`429` | Rate or quota exceeded | Implement exponential backoff with jitter; request higher limits in the dashboard.
`401/403` | Invalid key or organization | Verify environment variables and workspace membership.
`500/502/503` | Service disruption | Retry a limited number of times; alert on sustained failures.

Use the `x-request-id` response header for tracing and `OpenAI-Organization` to scope analytics per workspace.

## Operational guardrails
1. **Server-only API calls**: Proxy browser or mobile requests through a backend route (see `/docs/quickstarts/js-server-route.md`).
2. **Observability**: Forward request metadata (timestamp, route, latency, token counts) to your logging stack. Scrub sensitive inputs.
3. **Safety**: Combine the Moderation API with domain-specific filters for uploads or user-generated content.
4. **Cost controls**: Set usage caps in the OpenAI dashboard and configure alerts via email or webhook.
5. **Change management**: Document model IDs and parameter defaults in configuration files so upgrades are reviewed intentionally.

## Troubleshooting checklist
- **Inconsistent outputs**: Lower `temperature`, add explicit system instructions, or adopt evaluation datasets for regression testing.
- **Tool call failures**: Validate function schemas; ensure tool execution returns JSON strings that match the contract.
- **Timeouts**: Increase HTTP client timeout slightly (OpenAI can take ~30 seconds for long outputs) and add streaming where feasible.
- **401 after rotation**: Restart applications or redeploy serverless functions so they pick up the new environment variables.
- **Hallucinated facts**: Introduce retrieval grounding or require citations before surfacing responses to end users.
