## Overview
Generative AI providers share common patterns—API keys, chat messages, embeddings—but differ in authentication, request headers, safety controls, and operating envelopes. This guide distills the practical differences between OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, and Anthropic so you can decide which platform fits your product and compliance needs.

### You’ll learn
- Key similarities and differences in endpoints, authentication, and request bodies
- How each provider handles safety policies, tool calls, and multimodal inputs
- Operational tradeoffs such as rate limits, regions, quotas, and observability hooks
- Migration tips to move between providers without rewriting your entire stack
- Questions to ask vendors before committing to a deployment

## Provider snapshot
| Dimension | OpenAI | Azure OpenAI | Anthropic |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Primary focus** | Fast iteration, broad SDK ecosystem, latest model features | Enterprise governance, Azure integration, regional control | Instruction following, safety controls, transparent headers |
| **Endpoints** | `https://api.openai.com/v1/*` | `https://{resource}.openai.azure.com/openai/*` | `https://api.anthropic.com/v1/*` |
| **Auth** | Bearer token header `Authorization: Bearer <key>` | Same header; key scoped to Azure resource | API key in `x-api-key` header + required `anthropic-version` |
| **Chat format** | `messages` array with `role` + `content` blocks; tool calls via `tool_calls` | Same as OpenAI but `model` must match deployment name; Azure query parameter for version | `messages` array with `role` + `content` blocks; tool use via `tool_choice` and `input_schema` |
| **Streaming** | Server-sent events (`data:` frames) | Same SSE stream; version pinned | SSE stream with `event: completion` frames |
| **Regions** | Global, US/EU datacenters | Azure regions by resource (limited availability per model) | US and EU endpoints (per account) |
| **Pricing/billing** | Consumption billing per token | Azure billing (per-subscription, can attach to enterprise agreements) | Direct billing via Anthropic account |

## Authentication and endpoint differences
All three providers rely on server-side API keys, but the mechanics vary:

- **OpenAI**: Issue a secret key in the OpenAI dashboard. Prefix requests with `Authorization: Bearer <key>` and optional `OpenAI-Organization` for workspace scoping. Rotate keys regularly and store them in secret managers.
- **Azure OpenAI**: Provision an Azure OpenAI resource; keys live under that resource and inherit Azure RBAC. Every request requires the deployment-specific base URL, e.g., `https://my-resource.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/my-4o/chat/completions?api-version=2024-06-01`.
- **Anthropic**: Supply the key via `x-api-key` plus the `anthropic-version` header. The version locks SDK behavior; refresh it when new API releases ship.

> **Tip:** Put provider secrets behind a feature flag or routing layer so you can switch vendors without redeploying clients.

## Request patterns and tooling
Each provider accepts JSON payloads but with subtle schema differences:

- **Message structure**: OpenAI and Azure share the same `role` (`system`, `user`, `assistant`, `tool`) semantics. Anthropic introduces `assistant` `content` blocks with either text or tool results, and requires a top-level `input` when using the Messages API.
- **Tool calling**: OpenAI exposes `tool_calls` with JSON schema definitions; Azure mirrors this exactly. Anthropic uses a `tool_choice` field and requires explicit tool schemas through the `tools` array, returning tool requests in `content` blocks.
- **Multimodal**: OpenAI’s GPT-4o family accepts text+image in a single message; Azure inherits that capability when the deployment supports it. Anthropic’s Claude 3 models support text+image inputs in separate content blocks. Video input remains limited to select preview models across providers.
- **Structured outputs**: OpenAI’s JSON mode and function calling enforce schema compliance. Anthropic provides the beta `tool_choice: "tool"` and `input_schema` for structured results. Use deterministic validators regardless of provider to reject malformed payloads.

### Example snippets
```ts
// OpenAI / Azure OpenAI (Node)
const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
  model: modelOrDeployment,
  messages: [
    { role: 'system', content: 'You draft concise release notes.' },
    { role: 'user', content: 'Summarize version 2.1 updates.' }
  ],
  tools: [
    {
      type: 'function',
      function: {
        name: 'fetchChangeLog',
        description: 'Return structured changelog entries',
        parameters: {
          type: 'object',
          properties: { version: { type: 'string' } },
          required: ['version']
        }
      }
    }
  ]
});
```

```python
# Anthropic (Python)
import os
from anthropic import Anthropic

client = Anthropic(api_key=os.environ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"])

message = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-haiku-20240307",
    max_tokens=400,
    system="You draft concise release notes.",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Summarize version 2.1 updates."}
    ],
    tools=[
        {
            "name": "fetchChangeLog",
            "description": "Return structured changelog entries",
            "input_schema": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {"version": {"type": "string"}},
                "required": ["version"]
            }
        }
    ]
)
```

## Safety controls and governance
- **OpenAI**: System-level safety policies apply by default. Use the Moderation API for pre/post checks and the Safety Spec for risk tiers. Workspace admins can configure organization-level rate limits and abuse monitoring.
- **Azure OpenAI**: Adds Azure AI Content Safety integration, network isolation (Private Link), customer-managed keys, and compliance certifications (HIPAA, FedRAMP High for select regions). Moderation policies align with Microsoft’s Responsible AI guidelines.
- **Anthropic**: Ships with `safety` parameters (e.g., `safety_tier`) and the Constitutional AI framework to balance helpfulness and harm avoidance. The Messages API includes beta `system` prompts for allowed/disallowed behaviors.

Plan for staged launches regardless of provider:

1. Add logging for prompt/response metadata (without PII).
2. Run red-team prompts against staging environments.
3. Define escalation paths for policy violations.

## Operational tradeoffs
| Consideration | OpenAI | Azure OpenAI | Anthropic |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Rate limits** | Tier-based per minute + tokens; see account dashboard | Configured per Azure resource and quota requests | Tiered limits; enterprise contracts available |
| **Observability** | Usage dashboards, API metrics, audit logs | Azure Monitor + Log Analytics; activity logs integrate with Sentinel | Usage reports in console; audit logs via support plan |
| **SLAs** | Best-effort; uptime status page | Azure standard SLA when deployed in multiple regions | Enterprise SLA available on request |
| **Support** | Email + community forum | Azure Support plans (Standard, Professional Direct, Premier) | Enterprise support packages |

## Decision playbook
Ask these questions before committing:

- **Data residency**: Do regulations require EU-only processing? Azure might win with region selection; Anthropic offers EU endpoints for Claude 3.
- **Procurement**: Does finance prefer Azure enterprise agreements? If yes, Azure OpenAI streamlines billing.
- **Feature fit**: Need rapid access to new models (e.g., GPT-4.1 previews)? OpenAI typically ships first.
- **Safety posture**: Need explicit, controllable policies and constitutional prompts? Anthropic provides detailed levers.
- **Latency and UX**: Measure round-trip times per region. Multi-region Azure deployments can reduce latency for global audiences.

## Migration checklist
1. Wrap provider SDK calls behind an internal interface (e.g., `LLMClient`).
2. Normalize message payloads and tool schemas to a shared format.
3. Store provider metadata (model ID, deployment name, version) alongside prompts.
4. Implement per-provider retry logic (headers and status codes differ).
5. Run regression evals when switching providers to catch subtle policy or token-limit changes.
