What we compare

- Auth style and endpoint base URLs
- Request body shapes (messages, tools/functions)
- Streaming support and ergonomics
- Operational considerations (rate limits, regions, latency)

Highlights

- OpenAI: broad model coverage, strong tooling ergonomics, widely used SDKs.
- Azure OpenAI: enterprise controls and regional choices; deployment indirection.
- Anthropic: strong instruction-following; explicit headers and safety levers.

Notes

- Exact token limits, pricing, and model catalogs change frequentlyâ€”always verify in official docs.
- Choose based on data locality, compliance needs, and feature fit (e.g., tool use, multi-modal, embeddings).
