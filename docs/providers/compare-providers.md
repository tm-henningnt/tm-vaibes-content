What we compare

- Auth style and endpoint base URLs
- Request body shapes (messages, tools/functions)
- Streaming support and ergonomics
- Operational considerations (rate limits, regions, latency)

Highlights

- OpenAI: broad model coverage, strong tooling ergonomics, widely used SDKs.
- Azure OpenAI: enterprise controls and regional choices; deployment indirection.
- Anthropic: strong instruction-following; explicit headers and safety levers.

Notes

- Exact token limits, pricing, and model catalogs change frequently—always verify in official docs.
- Choose based on data locality, compliance needs, and feature fit (e.g., tool use, multi-modal, embeddings).

Quick decision guide

- Need enterprise Azure controls and regional data locality → Azure OpenAI.
- Need broad SDK ecosystem and fastest start → OpenAI.
- Prefer strong instruction adherence and explicit safety levers → Anthropic.

Migration pointers

- OpenAI → Azure OpenAI: use deployment names and `api-version`; see `/docs/providers/azure-openai/migrate-from-openai.md`.
- Cross-provider tools: keep function schemas minimal and idempotent; see `/docs/patterns/tools/function-calling.md`.
