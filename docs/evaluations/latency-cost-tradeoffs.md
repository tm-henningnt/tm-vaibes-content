Levers

- Smaller models for simple tasks; escalate only when needed.
- Stream first tokens; prioritize concise outputs.
- Cache heavy retrievals and summaries.
- Trim conversation history; summarize earlier turns.

Measure

- Track P50/P95 latency and tokens per route; compare before/after changes.
