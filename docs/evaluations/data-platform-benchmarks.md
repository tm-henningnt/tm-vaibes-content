Harness

- Fix datasets and queries; run with warm/cold caches.
- Capture tokens, provider latency, platform latency, total end‑to‑end.

Reports

- Compare regions, warehouses, and concurrency; highlight cheapest acceptable options.

Reproducibility

- Version the benchmark config and pin dependency versions.
