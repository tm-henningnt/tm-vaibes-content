ChatGPT Business offers an isolated analysis environment that can explore your files, write Python, and render charts without leaking workspace data. This tutorial shows how to move from a raw CSV upload to a vetted insight package and highlights controls that keep personally identifiable information (PII) out of your outputs.

## You’ll learn
- Prep datasets and prompts so ChatGPT’s data analysis sandbox produces reliable results.
- Use Python, pandas, and plotting helpers inside ChatGPT to build and export visuals.
- Validate insights with spot checks, guardrails, and reproducible scripts.
- Manage file retention, workspace policies, and audit artifacts for regulated teams.

## Prerequisites
- ChatGPT Business or Enterprise plan with **Advanced Data Analysis** enabled.
- Access to a clean sample dataset (CSV, XLSX, or JSON) that is cleared for internal analysis.
- Workspace policies covering PII handling and data retention.
- Optional: Local Python 3.10+ environment for offline verification.

## How ChatGPT handles files

When you upload a file, ChatGPT copies it into a transient sandbox that executes Python code and persists only within the conversation session. The flow below illustrates how requests move through the system.

    participant User

    participant Sandbox as Data analysis sandbox
    participant Output as Conversation transcript
    User->>ChatGPT: Upload CSV + prompt
    ChatGPT->>Sandbox: Spin up container, load file
    Sandbox->>Sandbox: Execute Python / SQL / visualization code
    Sandbox-->>ChatGPT: Return tables, charts, logs
    ChatGPT-->>Output: Render insight with citations + attachments
    Note over ChatGPT,Output: Workspace retention window applies; admins can delete conversations.
```

**Key properties**

- Files stay within your workspace; OpenAI’s [data control documentation](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8554397-data-controls-in-chatgpt) confirms customer prompts are excluded from model training for Business and Enterprise plans.
- Sandbox sessions expire after inactivity, so download notebooks or scripts you want to keep.
- Administrators can enforce conversation retention limits and export logs for audit review.

## Prepare the dataset and prompt spec

Create a short prompt spec before you start the conversation. It keeps your session grounded and clarifies guardrails.

```text
# Intent
Understand weekly revenue trends for our freemium product without exposing user PII.

# Inputs
- File: app-signups.csv (columns: signup_date, plan, revenue, region, acquisition_channel)
- Workspace policy: Mask any sub-1,000 cohort metrics.

# Outputs
- Summary paragraph with top trends and anomalies.
- Chart: 4-week rolling revenue by plan.
- Table: Cohorts failing retention target with anonymized notes.

# Constraints
- Use pandas only; no external HTTP calls.
- Flag rows missing revenue before analysis.

# Risks & mitigations
- Risk: False spikes from partial weeks → Mitigation: Align to ISO week start.
- Risk: Sensitive regions exposed → Mitigation: Aggregate to macro regions.

# Evaluation hooks
- Manual: Cross-check totals with finance dashboard.
- Automated: Export Python script that recomputes metrics locally.
```

Start your ChatGPT conversation with the intent section and upload the dataset in the same message. Ask ChatGPT to restate the plan before it touches the data.

## Walkthrough: Analyze a CSV safely

1. **Kick off with validation.** Prompt: “Confirm the file loaded, show column names, and report null counts.” Require a short bullet list of data quality findings.
2. **Guard against PII.** Provide a policy reminder: “Mask user_email and user_id fields. Replace with hashed placeholders when displaying samples.”
3. **Compute metrics with commentary.** Request grouped summaries: “Calculate weekly revenue by plan using ISO week start on Mondays. Return a tidy DataFrame and describe the largest delta.”
4. **Extract anomalies.** Ask for z-score filtering or rolling comparisons. Example: “Identify weeks where revenue deviated by >2 standard deviations from the 8-week rolling mean and list plausible causes.”
5. **Document checks.** Instruct ChatGPT to output a markdown checklist noting which validation steps passed, which need manual review, and any follow-up actions.
6. **Export artifacts.** Use `%%writefile analysis.py` inside the conversation so the final Python script can be downloaded for offline reruns. Request a CSV export of anomaly rows using `df.to_csv('anomalies.csv', index=False)`.

### Example Python snippet inside ChatGPT

```python
import pandas as pd

raw = pd.read_csv(uploaded_files["app-signups.csv"])
raw["signup_date"] = pd.to_datetime(raw["signup_date"])
raw = raw.set_index("signup_date").sort_index()
weekly = (
    raw
    .resample("W-MON")
    .agg({"revenue": "sum", "plan": "first", "region": "first"})
    .rename_axis("week_start")
    .reset_index()
)
weekly["rolling_revenue"] = weekly["revenue"].rolling(window=4, min_periods=1).mean()
weekly.to_csv("weekly_rollup.csv", index=False)
```

Prompt ChatGPT to annotate the code with comments, explain each transformation, and flag where manual validation is required.

## Generate charts and narratives

Use conversational prompts to iterate on visuals:

- “Plot rolling_revenue vs week_start for each plan in a single figure. Include axis labels, legend, and a shaded deployment window for launch week 2024-11-04.”
- “Render a bar chart of acquisition_channel share for the last full month. Annotate the largest month-over-month change.”
- “Export the chart as `rolling_revenue.png` and attach it to the conversation.”

After each chart:

1. Ask ChatGPT to summarize the visual in 2–3 bullet points.
2. Request a markdown table mapping each insight to the chart asset filename for future reference.
3. Save the conversation transcript and download the PNG for your documentation repository.

## Validate insights before sharing

Combine automated and manual checks to prevent erroneous reporting.

| Validation layer | What to do inside ChatGPT | Offline follow-up |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Data sanity | Rerun `df.describe()` and ensure counts match source dashboards. | Spot-check 3–5 records against the upstream database. |
| Business rules | Prompt: “Confirm no cohort smaller than 1,000 users is surfaced. If any exist, aggregate upward.” | Have a finance stakeholder confirm thresholds. |
| Reproducibility | Request ChatGPT to provide a shell command list to recreate outputs locally. | Run the exported `analysis.py` script with your local Python environment and compare results. |
| Narrative accuracy | Ask for citations to specific code cells or DataFrame filters. | Peer-review the summary with another analyst before publishing. |

## Manage retention and compliance

- **Retention windows:** Encourage teammates to delete the conversation once insights are ported to your BI tool. Admins can configure retention via the [ChatGPT Business admin console](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chatgpt-business/admin-console) to enforce automatic purges.
- **Sensitive files:** Require redaction or synthetic datasets for regulated domains. Maintain a catalog of approved sample files so analysts can practice without production data.
- **Audit trail:** Store exported scripts, anomaly tables, and the prompt spec in your version control system. Tag commits with the corresponding ticket ID for traceability.
- **Workspace policies:** Reiterate policies in each session (“This workspace prohibits uploading government IDs”). ChatGPT can append the policy to every notebook cell header for visibility.

## Troubleshooting

- **Large files (>50 MB):** Compress to Parquet or split into logical subsets. Mention the chunking plan in your prompt so ChatGPT knows how to reassemble.
- **Chart rendering errors:** Ask ChatGPT to print the matplotlib backend and switch to `plotly.express` if interactive controls are needed. Remember to export static images for archival.
- **Timeouts:** Keep cells short; when code exceeds the sandbox limit, ask ChatGPT to stream outputs incrementally (e.g., compute metrics per region). Download partial results before regenerating.
- **Policy reminders ignored:** If ChatGPT surfaces PII after multiple prompts, stop the session, file a workspace feedback ticket, and document the transcript for compliance review.

## Next steps

- Adapt the prompt spec to new datasets (finance, product analytics, support queues) and maintain a shared template library in your knowledge base.
- Connect this workflow with `/docs/examples/data-quality-qa.md` to pre-scan datasets before analysis.
- Pair with `/docs/tutorials/chatgpt-business/custom-gpts-and-policies.md` to automate policy reminders via custom GPT instructions.
