Custom GPTs let you package instructions, files, and API actions into a reusable assistant for your organization. This guide shows how to ship a governed GPT—from drafting the spec to enforcing policies, reviewing logs, and iterating safely.

## You’ll learn
- Capture business goals, scope, and constraints in a reusable custom GPT spec.
- Configure instructions, knowledge files, and actions that comply with workspace policies.
- Pilot with a small group, monitor feedback, and promote a GPT to general availability.
- Establish versioning, retirement, and audit practices aligned with regulated teams.

## Prerequisites
- ChatGPT Business or Enterprise workspace with **Custom GPTs** enabled for builders.
- Approved workspace policies covering data classification, action usage, and retention.
- Access to required external APIs with service accounts or OAuth credentials.
- Collaboration with legal, security, and support stakeholders for review checkpoints.

## Draft a custom GPT spec

Start with a written spec before opening the builder. Include purpose, users, guardrails, and evaluation hooks.

```text
# Assistant summary
Provide tier-1 support agents with concise troubleshooting steps for the HelpDesk product.

# Allowed users
- HelpDesk Support L1 queue (15 agents)
- Support managers (read-only)

# In-scope tasks
- Classify ticket severity from customer description.
- Suggest three troubleshooting steps referencing the internal KB.
- Prepare a summary for CRM handoff using approved template.

# Out-of-scope tasks
- Issue refunds or credits.
- Access customer billing details.
- Generate new troubleshooting procedures without human review.

# Safety & compliance
- Mask customer email addresses and phone numbers.
- Link to KB articles by ID (KB-XXXX) without copying full confidential text.
- Log every action execution with ticket ID, timestamp, and actor.

# Evaluation
- Weekly spot checks of 10 transcripts with severity accuracy ≥ 95%.
- Monthly audit to confirm no refund-related prompts were fulfilled.
```

Share the spec in your project tracker and obtain approval before building.

## Configure the custom GPT in the builder

1. **Create** → **Custom GPT** → select **Create**.
2. Fill out the **Name** and **Description** using phrases from the spec so teammates recognize the purpose.
3. Paste a structured instruction block. Example:

```text
## Role
You are the HelpDesk First-Response Assistant.

## Tone
Professional, concise, empathetic.

## Process
1. Restate the customer issue in one sentence.
2. Classify severity on a 1–4 scale and cite policy section.
3. Provide up to three numbered troubleshooting steps linking KB IDs.
4. Offer to escalate if the customer mentions downtime or data loss.

## Guardrails
- Never promise refunds or SLAs.
- Mask personally identifiable information before echoing customer text.
- Ask for manager approval for severity 4 (critical) tickets.
```

4. **Knowledge**: Upload sanitized PDFs or markdown excerpts, not full internal wikis. Tag each file with metadata (e.g., `kb-version:2025-02`).
5. **Actions**: Define API connectors that implement idempotent operations such as retrieving KB articles or logging summaries.

### Action design checklist

- Use read-only HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST` to logging endpoints) unless explicitly approved.
- Add schema validation and error codes. For example, require `ticket_id`, `summary`, and `severity` fields in the request body.
- Set timeouts (≤15 seconds) and retries with exponential backoff.
- Provide a redaction layer so responses exclude secrets.

## Workflow governance

Adopt a staged release pipeline to control who can use the GPT and how updates ship.

    ga --> monitor[Monitoring & feedback]
    monitor --> iterate[Versioned updates]
    iterate --> sunset[Retirement checklist]
```

### Stage 1: Policy review
- Share the spec, instructions, and action schemas with security and legal.
- Run `/docs/concepts/safety-basics.md` checklist: jailbreak risk, data leakage, user escalation path.
- Confirm admins can revoke access or disable the GPT if misuse occurs.

### Stage 2: Pilot release
- Limit distribution to a **pilot list** via the custom GPT sharing settings.
- Provide a kickoff doc covering intended use, logging expectations, and support contacts.
- Collect transcripts for the first week and tag issues (false severity, policy gaps) in your tracker.

### Stage 3: General availability
- Update instructions based on pilot feedback; version instructions by date (e.g., `Instructions v2025-02-10`).
- Publish to the full workspace only after sign-off from stakeholders.
- Announce in internal channels with links to `/docs/tutorials/chatgpt-business/data-analysis-and-files.md` and `/docs/examples/meeting-summarizer.md` for adjacent workflows.

### Stage 4: Monitoring and iteration
- Enable conversation export for admins. Review weekly transcripts using stratified sampling.
- Instrument actions to emit logs to your SIEM (e.g., Splunk, Azure Monitor) with fields: GPT name, action, status, error message.
- Track key metrics: adoption, resolution time delta, escalation rate. Compare to pre-launch baselines.

### Stage 5: Retirement
- When deprecating, update instructions to redirect users (“This GPT is retiring on 2025-06-30; use the Support Runbook GPT”).
- Archive knowledge files and revoke API credentials.
- Document lessons learned and store the spec in your governance wiki.

## Embed policies directly into the GPT

- **Instruction headers:** Include policy snippets (“Do not process PCI data”).
- **Conversation starters:** Offer prompts that reinforce scope (“Summarize ticket HD-2041 without exposing PII”).
- **Response format:** Require a compliance footer, e.g., “Reviewed against Support Policy 3.2”.
- **Fallback handling:** Provide explicit refusal language for out-of-scope requests.

## Evaluation and testing

| Checkpoint | Method | Target |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Instruction accuracy | Prompt spec regression test (upload transcripts to the GPT builder evaluator). | ≥ 90% correct severity tags. |
| Action safety | Replay 20 pilot transcripts against a mock API environment. | Zero unauthorized mutations. |
| Data leakage | Red-team prompts attempting to expose PII or KB secrets. | GPT refuses or redacts in 100% of trials. |
| Usability | Survey pilot agents on clarity and helpfulness. | ≥ 4/5 average rating. |

Automate regression tests by exporting interaction logs and running them through `/docs/evaluations/prompt-regression.md` (if available) or a custom script that checks for policy phrases.

## Troubleshooting

- **GPT ignores guardrails:** Tighten instructions, add negative examples (“If asked for refunds, say you cannot do that”), and consider disabling for retraining.
- **Action errors:** Inspect action logs; ensure service accounts have minimum required scopes. Add retries with jitter if rate limited.
- **Policy drift:** Schedule quarterly reviews with policy owners. Document revisions in your changelog.
- **User confusion:** Provide a quickstart video or link to `/docs/quickstarts/try-genai-in-10-min.md` for onboarding basics.
