You can treat ChatGPT as a remote pair-programmer: describe intent, share diffs, and keep a tight review loop while protecting production systems. This playbook shows how to plan coding sessions, request diffs safely, debug issues, and capture learnings for future automation.

## You’ll learn
- Structure prompts for diffs, refactors, and debugging conversations.
- Apply guardrails that keep secrets, credentials, and customer data out of ChatGPT.
- Combine Canvas, inline chat, and GitHub Copilot so each tool handles the work it does best.
- Track evaluation hooks that prove AI-generated changes meet your engineering standards.

## Session preparation checklist
- Confirm you are on ChatGPT Business or Enterprise; personal tiers lack enterprise controls.
- Identify the codebase, branch, and testing commands you will run locally.
- Gather context: architecture docs, style guides, and open issues.
- Decide which artifacts (files, stack traces, test logs) you can safely share. Redact secrets and customer data.
- Set exit criteria: e.g., “function passes integration tests and docs updated.”

## Prompt building blocks
Use these primitives to keep conversations focused and auditable.

### Context primer
Explain the domain before requesting changes.

```
Project: payments-service
Stack: Node.js 20, Fastify, Prisma
Goal: add idempotency keys to POST /v1/payouts
Constraints: maintain 200ms p95 latency, reuse existing retry helper
Tests to run: pnpm test payouts
```

Paste this context at the top of the chat or Canvas conversation so every later message inherits the scope.

### Diff requests
Prefer explicit diff prompts to “rewrite the file.”

```
Task: update src/routes/payouts.ts to store idempotency keys

1. Show unified diff against the snippet below.
2. Explain each hunk briefly.
3. Point out any follow-up migrations or docs work.

```ts
<existing code here>
```
```

Ask ChatGPT to generate patches with rationale. Apply them locally using `git apply` or your editor, then run tests yourself.

### Refactor scripts
When you need multiple file changes, instruct ChatGPT to plan first.

1. “List the steps required to extract a `RateLimiter` class; wait for my approval.”
2. Review the plan; add acceptance criteria.
3. “Generate diffs for steps 1–2 only. Stop after each diff so I can run tests.”
4. Keep a change log (timestamp, goal, files touched) in the conversation or a local journal.

### Debugging assistance
Share error messages and relevant code, but never live logs containing personal data.

```
Error: Unique constraint failed on the fields: (`user_id`,`payout_id`)
Context: happens after enabling idempotency keys
Provided tests: pnpm test payouts --watch
Requested help: propose three hypotheses, then suggest instrumentation to confirm.
```

Ask for hypotheses first, not fixes. Run the proposed instrumentation locally and feed the results back for iterative troubleshooting.

## Guardrails and governance
- **Data minimization:** strip secrets, tokens, and customer data before sharing. Use placeholders like `<API_KEY>`.
- **Access control:** limit Canvas exports and workspace members to the team handling the project.
- **Change control:** never merge AI-generated code without human review, tests, and linting.
- **Logging:** keep a session log referencing conversation URLs, Canvas export IDs, and applied commits.
- **Red-teaming:** periodically prompt ChatGPT with malicious requests (e.g., “skip validation”) to ensure it resists unsafe changes.

## Integrating with developer tools
- **Canvas:** use for greenfield scaffolding or major reorganizations, then export to Git.
- **ChatGPT inline (in-app):** great for quick diffs, stack-trace triage, and doc updates.
- **GitHub Copilot:** complements ChatGPT by generating inline suggestions as you type; treat outputs as drafts.
- **Issue trackers:** copy key decisions and next steps into Jira, Linear, or GitHub Issues for visibility.
- **CI systems:** wire quality checks (tests, linting, type checks) to run automatically on AI-assisted branches.

## Evaluation hooks for AI-assisted changes
- **Automated tests:** expand unit/integration tests whenever ChatGPT edits behavior.
- **Static analysis:** run linting, type checks, and security scanners (e.g., ESLint, mypy, Bandit) locally.
- **Canary deploys:** release behind feature flags or percentage rollouts before global launch.
- **Human-in-the-loop QA:** pair with domain experts for UX or compliance validation.
- **Metrics review:** compare latency, error rate, and cost before/after AI-generated changes.

## Retrospectives and continuous improvement
- Schedule short retros after significant AI-assisted workstreams.
- Capture what context helped, which prompts caused confusion, and what evaluation gaps you observed.
- Update internal playbooks with improved prompt templates and guardrails.
- Share sanitized transcripts with your security or compliance team for transparency.
