Components

- Retries: short exponential backoff with jitter; cap attempts.
- Rate limits: per-user and global; queue with timeouts.
- Backpressure: shed load or degrade features when queues grow.
- Circuit breaker: open under sustained failures; halfâ€‘open probes.

Verification

- Chaos tests: inject 429/5xx; verify fallbacks and alerts fire.
