Controls

- Set `max_tokens` and concise prompts; prefer short answers by default.
- Use streaming UIs; early-cancel when user has enough.
- Truncate long histories; summarize earlier context.
- Cache frequent prompts or retrievals where feasible.
- Add backoff and cap retries to bound waste.

Monitoring

- Track tokens and latency by route; alert when thresholds exceeded.

Beginner guide

- Start with small models and low `max_tokens`.
- Prefer single-turn prompts; split large requests into smaller steps when possible.

Advanced

- Cache embeddings and RAG retrieval results; reuse across sessions.
- Use budget-aware planners that reduce model size or shorten prompts when low on budget.
