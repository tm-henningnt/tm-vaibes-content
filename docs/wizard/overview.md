## Flow
1. **Vision & Audience** → clarify goals and who benefits.
2. **Solution Shape** → choose patterns and data needs.
3. **Launch Readiness** → risks, evaluation, and success metrics.
4. **Review & Outputs** → brief, metrics, backlog, recap prompt.

## Sessions
- Drafts are auto-saved with timestamps and provider/model metadata.
- You can duplicate sessions for iterative exploration.
- Soft-delete and archival flags enable future retention/reporting.
