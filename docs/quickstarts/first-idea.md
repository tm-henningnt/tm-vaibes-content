## Prerequisites
- An idea worth testing (no tech required).

## Steps
1. Write a one-sentence value proposition.
2. Define the primary audience and one high-value scenario.
3. List the data and tools your solution will need (sources, integrations, existing systems).
4. Draft three measurable success metrics (quality, speed, cost, or satisfaction).
5. Summarize the solution shape in five bullet points, including risks and open questions.

## Whatâ€™s next
- Move into build mode with `/docs/quickstarts/try-genai-in-10-min.md`.
- Study agent planning patterns in `/docs/patterns/agentic/planner-executor.md`.
