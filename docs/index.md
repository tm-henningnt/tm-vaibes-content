# Welcome

Pick a path to start:

- **Absolute beginner**: Learn what GenAI and agentic systems are, then try the 10‑minute quickstart.
- **PM / Non‑technical**: Frame a use case, define success metrics, and explore evaluation guides.
- **Developer (JS/TS)**: Set up providers, build secure server routes, and explore agent patterns.
- **Python / Data practitioner**: Focus on retrieval, tooling, and quantitative evaluations.
- **Security & governance**: Review safety practices, guardrails, and observability patterns.

> Tip: Use page tags and the built-in search to filter by audience and topic.
