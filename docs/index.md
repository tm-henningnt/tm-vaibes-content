# Welcome

Pick a path to start:

- **Absolute beginner**: Learn what GenAI and agents are, then try a 10‑minute quickstart.
- **PM / Non‑technical**: Frame a use case, define success, and run the wizard.
- **Developer (JS/TS)**: Set up providers and explore agent patterns.
- **Python / Data practitioner**: Retrieval, tools, and evals.
- **Admin / Security**: Entra setup, content sync, and observability.

> Tip: Use page tags and the built-in search to filter by audience and topic.
