## Overview
Agentic systems chain multiple steps—plan, call tools, reflect—to reach goals that single prompts struggle with.

### You’ll learn
- Tradeoffs between single‑shot prompting and agentic flows
- When to add tools, memory, or reflection loops
- Cost, latency, and failure mode implications

## Comparison
- Single‑shot: faster, cheaper, limited context and controllability.
- Agentic: more control, tool access, better reliability; higher complexity and cost.

## Decisions
- Start simple; add steps/tools only when necessary.
- Add evaluation hooks early to avoid regressions.

## Key differences
- Single-shot vs. goal-directed multi-step loops
- Deterministic pipelines vs. stochastic reasoning
- Tool use, memory, and planning
