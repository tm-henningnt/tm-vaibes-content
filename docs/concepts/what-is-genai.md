## Overview

Generative AI (GenAI) refers to models that can produce new content—text, code, images, audio, and more—conditioned on your inputs. This page explains strengths, limitations, and good use cases.

### You’ll learn
- What GenAI is and how it differs from classic automation
- Where GenAI shines—and where it struggles
- How to frame problems for GenAI vs. non‑GenAI approaches

## Capabilities and limits
- Strengths: pattern synthesis, language understanding, flexible outputs.
- Limits: factuality, tool constraints, context windows, cost/latency.

## When to use GenAI
- Ideation, drafting, summarization, transformation, structured extraction with schema checks.
- Avoid for safety‑critical, high‑precision tasks without guardrails, or where deterministic rules exist.
