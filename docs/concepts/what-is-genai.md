## Introduction
Generative AI (GenAI) refers to models that synthesize new content—text, code, images, audio, or video—conditioned on human instructions or other inputs. These models are trained on large corpora and can generalize to new prompts without task-specific fine-tuning. This guide explains what GenAI is, what it excels at, where it fails, and how to decide whether it belongs in your solution.

### You’ll learn
- Core mental models for how large language models (LLMs) generate outputs
- Practical strengths and limitations you can explain to non-technical stakeholders
- A decision checklist to assess GenAI fit before building
- How to frame prompts and guardrails for safe, reliable deployments
- Where to find deeper dives on prompting, agents, and safety

## Mental models for generative AI
Think about GenAI using two complementary perspectives:

1. **Statistical next-token prediction.** At inference time, an LLM predicts the most likely next token based on the prior tokens and its training data. This explains variability, hallucinations, and why clear instructions matter.
2. **Tool-augmented reasoning.** Modern systems pair the core model with retrieval, function calling, or external tools to ground answers in current data and extend beyond raw training knowledge.

These mental models help you reason about tradeoffs:

- **Prompt clarity** reduces ambiguity for the probabilistic predictor.
- **Context windows** bound how much information the model can consider at once.
- **External tools** mitigate knowledge gaps but add latency, cost, and complexity.

## Strengths and limitations

| Area | Where GenAI shines | Where it struggles |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Language understanding** | Summaries, translations, tone adjustments, draft generation | Domain-specific jargon without examples; long legal or regulatory nuance |
| **Reasoning** | Lightweight planning, brainstorming alternatives, data explanation when context is supplied | Multi-step arithmetic, strict logical proofs, adversarial or ambiguous instructions |
| **Knowledge** | Broad coverage of public web content up to training cutoff; codifies best practices | Real-time facts, proprietary data, evolving regulations |
| **Output formats** | Flexible natural language, pseudo-code, structured JSON (with schema guidance) | Strictly deterministic outputs, binary files, raw media generation without specialized models |
| **Safety** | Built-in policy filters, can refuse unsafe requests | Susceptible to jailbreak prompts, may leak sensitive training data if misconfigured |

> **Tip:** Pair every GenAI workflow with human review, logging, or automated evaluation when outcomes influence compliance, revenue, or safety-critical systems.

## Cost, latency, and reliability constraints

- **Tokens drive cost and latency.** Each request consumes input and output tokens, billed per model. Favor concise prompts, caching, and streaming responses when users need fast feedback.
- **Model selection matters.** Smaller, cheaper models (e.g., GPT-4o mini) handle drafting or summarization; larger models (e.g., GPT-4.1, Claude 3 Opus) deliver stronger reasoning at higher latency and cost.
- **Determinism is limited.** Even with `temperature: 0`, LLMs can vary across runs. Use guardrails such as schema validation, retries, and eval suites to monitor quality.

## Decision checklist: Should you use GenAI?

1. **Define the outcome.** Can the task tolerate non-deterministic outputs or require creativity? If precise, rule-based outcomes are required, consider classic automation first.
2. **Check data availability.** Do you have high-quality prompts, examples, or retrieval sources to ground answers? Without them, expect hallucinations.
3. **Evaluate constraints.** Identify latency budgets, cost ceilings, and privacy requirements. If you cannot keep data server-side or anonymized, GenAI may be off the table.
4. **Plan for review.** Decide who verifies outputs, how feedback is captured, and what metrics define success (accuracy, tone, safety).
5. **Start small.** Pilot with a single narrow use case, measure performance, and expand only when the system consistently meets acceptance criteria.

## Common use cases

- **Drafting and ideation:** Marketing copy, meeting agendas, support replies, product brainstorms.
- **Summarization and classification:** Condensing long documents, tagging customer feedback, extracting key entities.
- **Transformation and localization:** Converting formats (JSON ↔️ prose), rewriting for tone, translating content with glossaries.
- **Conversational assistants:** Context-aware chatbots that retrieve internal knowledge and maintain session state.
- **Developer productivity:** Code review assistance, test scaffolding, API exploration with built-in safety guardrails.

Avoid deploying GenAI without additional controls for:

- **Safety-critical domains** (medical, legal, financial decisions) unless humans remain in the loop.
- **Deterministic transformations** where regexes or rules guarantee accuracy.
- **Bulk personal data processing** if you cannot comply with privacy policies or data residency requirements.

## Implementation guardrails

- **Secure the API key.** Keep provider keys on the server, rotate them regularly, and restrict scopes.
- **Instrument everything.** Log request IDs, token usage, latency, and user/session metadata (no raw prompts or PII) to spot regressions.
- **Test with eval sets.** Build a small golden dataset and use automatic grading or human review cycles to gauge accuracy before launch.
- **Plan for fallback paths.** Offer manual escalation, cached answers, or deterministic flows when the model cannot comply.
